## üöÄ Installation

This tool is built with Python and requires a few external dependencies to function fully.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python**: A modern version of Python (3.9 or newer) is recommended.
2.  **A Downloader**: The tool is designed to call an external downloader.
    *   **`gytmdl`** (Recommended): A feature-rich downloader specifically for YouTube Music. Install with `pip install gytmdl`.
3.  **FFmpeg**: Your chosen downloader will almost certainly require FFmpeg for audio processing. Ensure it is installed and available in your system's PATH.
4.  **Clipboard Tool** (Optional): To enable the copy-to-clipboard feature, the `pyperclip` library is used.

### Setup
1.  ```
    git clone https://github.com/SK2006MC/findYTmusic-tui
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Highly Recommended)
    This isolates the project's dependencies from your system's Python.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install "textual[dev]" ytmusicapi pyperclip
    ```

## üîß Usage

With your virtual environment activated, simply run the script:

```bash
python find_ytmusic_tui.py
```

| `q` or `Ctrl+C`      | Quit the application                   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application's behavior can be easily adjusted by modifying the `Config` class at the top of the `find_ytmusic_tui.py` script.

```python
@dataclass
class Config:
    """Holds all application configuration."""
    SEARCH_RESULT_LIMIT: int = 25
    DOWNLOAD_COMMAND: str = "gytmdl"
```

*   `SEARCH_RESULT_LIMIT`: Change the number of results to fetch per search.
*   `DOWNLOAD_COMMAND`: Change this to your preferred downloader, for example: `"yt-dlp"`. The tool will automatically detect if the command exists in your PATH.
